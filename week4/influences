I was influnced a lot by my mom growing up. After my parents divorced, she was my hero. My mom was a police officer for 23 years,
and she spent a lot of that time working nights and making ends meet to make sure that I had everything I needed as a child, and that I 
did, my mom worked her tail off to be the best parent that she could ve. I am ever so grateful to her vfor everything that she has done
for me, I believe that she has truly gone above and beyond as a parent. She taught me to be the person that I am today, and she will always
be my idol
