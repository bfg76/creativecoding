Listening to this lecture, more than anything, made me feel empowered. I believe that the thing that affected me the most was the thought
in the back of my head that Randy Pausch was battling pancreatic cancer, and while that led to his ultimate and unfortunate passing in 
2008, he would still go on to cofound the Entertainment Technology Center and become a well respected college professor in computer science
for over a decade. I believe that this lecture was meant to be a sort of last words that Randy Pausch would say to a group of students if he knew it
was his "last lecture", and he delivered. Pausch was energetic and even did push ups on the stage, leaving his legacy as one to never be
forgotten. A lecture like this made me want to go out and do everything in a day, i felt like I could touch the moon if I jumped high enough,
this was definitely a last lecture to be remembered
