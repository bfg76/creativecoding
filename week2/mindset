After taking the test, I was aligned mostly with a growth mindset, but it wasn't neccesarily close. I agreed with 4 fixed mindset ideas
compared to 5 growth mindset ideas. I feel mostly conflicted after a test like that, because it is my personal opinion that you can't 
change how much talent you have, I believe that is something you are born with and that you can only increase your skill at a task 
through hard work and dedication. I personally define talent as something that gives you natural skill at something without much effort
On the other side of the spectrum, I was aligned mostly with a growth mindset when it came to intelligence. I believe intelligence
is something that grows when you work to improve it. Where skill and talent are two seperate things, intelligence is its own area and
can be improved as such
